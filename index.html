                    <strong>Neerja Bhanot, Ashoka Chakra </strong>(7 September 1963 – 5 September 1986) was an 
                    Indian head purser who died while saving passengers on Pan Am Flight 73 which had been hijacked 
                    by terrorists from a terrorist organization during a stopover in Karachi, Pakistan, on 5 September 1986, 
                    just two days before her 23rd birthday. Posthumously, she became the youngest recipient of India's 
                    highest peacetime gallantry, the Ashoka Chakra Award, as well as several other accolades from the 
                    governments of Pakistan and the United States. She was shot while helping passengers escape through 
                    the emergency exits.
                    <br><br>
                    Neerja Bhanot was born in Chandigarh, India, and brought up in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) in a Punjabi Hindu 
                    Brahmin family.She was the daughter of Harish Bhanot, a Bombay-based journalist, and Rama Bhanot. She had 
                    two brothers, Akhil and Aneesh Bhanot.She received her early schooling at Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School 
                    in Chandigarh. When the family moved to Bombay, she continued her studies at Bombay Scottish School and 
                    then graduated from St. Xavier's College, Bombay.[1] It was in Bombay where she was first spotted for a 
                    modelling assignment which began her modelling career.
                    <br><br>
                    Bhanot was the Senior Flight Purser on Pan Am Flight 73 flying from Mumbai to the United States via Karachi 
                    and Frankfurt, which was hijacked by four armed men on 5 September 1986 at Karachi airport in Pakistan. The 
                    aircraft was carrying 380 passengers and 13 crew members. The terrorists wanted to fly to Cyprus with the goal 
                    of freeing Palestinian prisoners in Cyprus. Bhanot was able to alert the cockpit crew as soon as the hijackers 
                    boarded the plane, and as the plane was on the apron, the three-member cockpit crew of pilot, co-pilot and the 
                    flight engineer fled from the aircraft through an overhead hatch in the cockpit. As the most senior cabin crew 
                    member, Bhanot took charge of the situation inside the plane.

                    qualities of the human spirit.”<h5>~Ashok Chakra citation</h5></span>
